### Comments

- All of the parts are there, it just needs some adjusting, for starters, the report part has too much radious and it makes it look kinda weird, then the time buttons section shouldnt be over the purple part, its the other way around on the figma, also the daily button messes with the "Jeremy Robson" text and makes it look weird.

the way you have your breakpoints makes it so the text becomes smaller past 1396 width.

between 1251 width and 1396 width the current display time text is too big and causes the whole thing to stretch.

theres no tablet responsiveness, it just skist straight to mobile, no idea if it's required but it would be nice.

on mobile, the purple part of the report card is too big, and also maybe add some spacing in between cards like in the figma.

I also noticed that your content is in a div with no justify center, try adding that because the distance from the left and the right of the screen is unevem.

## Addressing the Peer Rebiew

1. I will work to fix the minor details. I lowered the rounded radius to rounded-4 from rounded-5 to match other cards. Fixed the color as suggested. As for "also the daily button messes with the "Jeremy Robson" text and makes it look weird." I don't know what you mean by this
2. Fixed it. It should be the other way around. bigger past the point and smaller beneath 1396
3. Fixed along with the problem above.
4. There was no Figma for a tablet version, so I made it so it simply shrinks down until it reaches the mobile version
5. Spacing added, but unsure what you mean by purple part is too big.
6. I got to center!!! should be all I can do before due date passes.
