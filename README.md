### Comments

- All of the parts are there, it just needs some adjusting, for starters, the report part has too much radious and it makes it look kinda weird, then the time buttons section shouldnt be 
over the purple part, its the other way around on the figma, also the daily button messes with the "Jeremy Robson" text and makes it look weird.

the way you have your breakpoints makes it so the text becomes smaller past 1396 width.

between 1251 width and 1396 width the current display time text is too big and causes the whole thing to stretch.

theres no tablet responsiveness, it just skist straight to mobile, no idea if it's required but it would be nice.

on mobile, the purple part of the report card is too big, and also maybe add some spacing in between cards like in the figma.

I also noticed that your content is in a div with no justify center, try adding that because the distance from the left and the right of the screen is unevem.
